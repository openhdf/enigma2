extendable format converter

Can be used to convert lamedb to a satellites.xml file, including TSID/ONID entries for example to check diseqc setups with the enigma2 diseqc checker plugin.

Just start lamedb2satxml for usage information.

A more general usage interface is present in main.py, where you can call the different modules directly via a console user interface.
